/// PODS 2007) without forking the evaluator.
///
/// ## Laws an implementor must satisfy
///
/// A commutative semiring under `plus`/`times` with identities `zero`/`one`:
///
/// 1. `plus` is associative and commutative, with `zero` as its identity.
/// 2. `times` is associative and commutative, with `one` as its identity.
/// 3. `times` distributes over `plus`.
/// 4. `zero` annihilates `times`.
///
/// and, because this is an incremental fixpoint rather than a one-shot
/// evaluation, two more that a plain semiring does not give you:
///
/// 5. **Monotonicity**: `a <= a.plus(b)` in the semiring's natural order --
///    an annotation may only ever grow as more derivations are found. Free
///    when `plus` is idempotent (i.e. the carrier is a join-semilattice).
/// 6. **Ascending chain condition**: no infinite strictly ascending chain,
///    or the fixpoint has no termination argument.
///
/// The default `Ann` satisfies 1-3, 5 and *not* 4 or 6: `zero` does not
/// annihilate the provenance component (`{} union p == p`), and `max` over
/// `f64` admits the infinite chain 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ... Neither bites today
